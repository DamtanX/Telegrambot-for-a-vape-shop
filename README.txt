This telegram bot was made on request of a vape dealer
and intended to be a comfortable tool to manage with
vape selling with russian interface.

To launch your bot using this code you should:
1. write your bot token instead of  YOUR_TOKEN_BOT
in line 89. You can get it using Father bot in 
telegram when you are creating your own bot.
2. Add your tg ID in the table owners in the
test.db and make a Permission column as 1(admin)
I recommend to use SQLiteDatabaseBrowserPortable.exe
for this actions, because of unserstandible UI.

What this bot can do:
1.keep tracking of clients with all necessary information about them,
which you can manage as you want.
2. Looking for every of your product, look if they are finished or not,
their cost and some extra information about them
3. Calculating profit. You can set a period which will be displayed
as your profit during this time

Actually because of C++ my exe file requires very little CPU and RAM 
resources.

Do not judge my code strictly, I am a beginner, I am glad if I will be 
usefull for someone, enjoy my work, suggest some ideas.
